# Welcome to Travelly!

## Project Overview:

In this project, we are planning to build an interactive social travel app. Our app will consist of multiple sections:

Budgeting Section: Users can set and edit their trip budget and allocate it to specific categories like accommodation, food, and activities. A progress bar will track their spending in real time, and a visual pie chart will give an overview of where their money is going. Users will receive warnings if they exceed their budget as well.

Interactive Calendar: Users can plan their days by adding activities directly onto a calendar, with costs automatically syncing to the overall budget. The calendar will allow for reminders and notifications for scheduled activities, ensuring users stay organized.

Interactive Map: This flagship feature lets users drop pins on a map, adding informartion like local restaurant recommendations, tips about tourist spots, or personal journal entries. Other users can view and interact with these pins (e.g., like or comment). By doing this, we will be able to create a community of travelers who collectively improve each other's experiences.

Events Section (Home): This feature provides a dynamic list of upcoming events based on the users location. This could be a football match in Milan, a rodeo in Calgary, or a concert in Downtown Toronto. Each event will include detailed information such as the event name, location, date, and time, and users will have the option to add events directly to their calendar. This integration ensures that users can seamlessly incorporate events into their travel plans. This section would be challenging as we would need to find a way to grab this information, parse it in a clean way, and update it dynamically.

Profile Page: This page allows users to view and update their personal information. Users can update their photo, location and bio. It also includes toggles for recieving notifications and enabling dark mode, giving users more control over their app experience.
