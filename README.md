# Welcome to Tavelly!

## Project Overview:

In this project, we are planning to build an interactive social travel app. Our app will consist of multiple sections. First, a budgeting section, where users will have the option to add and edit their budget for a trip. Then, an interactive calendar where users can plan out their days and add the cost of each activity, which will reflect in their budget and a warning will be thrown if they go over budget. Thirdly, the flagship feature of this app will be the interactive map, where users will be able to drop pins with useful information about places they have been to. This could be local restaurant recommendations, tips and tricks around touristic sites, a small journal entry, etc. By doing this, we will be able to create a community of travelers who collectively improve each other's experiences. We will also be exploring a 4th section, in which we will give users a list of upcoming events taking place in and around their location. This could be a football match in Milan, a rodeo in Calgary, or a concert in Downtown Toronto. This section would be challenging as we would need to find a way to grab this information, parse it in a clean way, and update it dynamically.
